The system supports three distinct user roles—customers, registered business owners, and administrators—each with dedicated workflows and interfaces, ensuring an appropriate experience for every type of access.",
      "qrypt": "QRypt was developed as an academic project focused on enhancing the security of QR Codes generated by digital applications. The project emerged in response to the growing threat of quishing, a form of phishing that uses QR Codes as an attack vector. In this practice, malicious actors place QR Codes in strategic locations to trick unsuspecting users into accessing malicious links or completing fraudulent payment actions.<break></break>QRypt aims to mitigate this problem by providing a secure environment for QR Code generation and validation, based on three core pillars: (1) mandatory user authentication for QR Code creation; (2) encryption of all generated QR Codes to ensure the integrity and validity of their content; and (3) a community-driven reporting mechanism that automatically disables a QR Code once it reaches a predefined number of reports, reducing the risk of misuse by malicious users."
